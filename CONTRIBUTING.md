## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 4.0.0 or higher (as specified in package.json)
- **Yarn**: This project uses Yarn as the package manager
- **Git**: For version control

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/memfs.git
   cd memfs
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/streamich/memfs.git
   ```

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

3. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

- **`yarn build`** - Compile TypeScript and build the project
- **`yarn test`** - Run the test suite
- **`yarn test:coverage`** - Run tests with coverage report
- **`yarn test:watch`** - Run tests in watch mode
- **`yarn tslint`** - Run TSLint for code linting
- **`yarn prettier`** - Format code with Prettier
- **`yarn prettier:check`** - Check code formatting
- **`yarn typecheck`** - Run TypeScript type checking

### Before Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make sure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

3. Ensure code formatting is correct:
   ```bash
   yarn prettier:check
   ```

### During Development

1. **Write tests** for any new functionality
2. **Run tests frequently** to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:
   ```bash
   yarn test:watch
   ```
3. **Check linting** regularly:
   ```bash
   yarn tslint
   ```
4. **Format your code** before committing:
   ```bash
   yarn prettier
   ```

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

2. Check TypeScript compilation:
   ```bash
   yarn typecheck
   ```

3. Verify code formatting:
   ```bash
   yarn prettier:check
   ```

4. Run linting:
   ```bash
   yarn tslint
   ```

## Code Style

This project uses:

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Prettier** for code formatting with the following configuration:
  - 120 character line width
  - 2 spaces for indentation
  - Single quotes
  - Trailing commas
  - Semicolons
- **TSLint** for additional code quality checks

Please ensure your code adheres to these standards by running `yarn prettier` before committing.

## Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format. Your commit messages should follow this pattern:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```
feat: add support for async file operations
fix: resolve memory leak in file handle cleanup
docs: update README with new API examples
test: add tests for edge cases in path resolution
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if your changes affect the public API
2. **Add or update tests** to cover your changes
3. **Ensure all checks pass** (tests, linting, formatting)
4. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what was changed and why
   - Reference to any related issues
