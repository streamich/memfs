# Synchronous `fs` in browser

This demo executes tests of **synchronous** Node.js API built on top of File
System Access API in browser.

There are two tests:

- OPFS &mdash; virtual file system built into browsers.
- Native File System Access API folder &mdash; a real folder that user explicitly grants permission to.

See the assertions run in the browser console.
